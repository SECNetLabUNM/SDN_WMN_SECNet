For our BATMAN installation, we used Ubuntu 20.04.06 LTS and Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit). We have confirmed that these two operating systems can run Batman IV and Batman V. 

The official BATMAN documentation can be referenced here:

## Installation of BATMAN
On a terminal, run:
`sudo apt install batctl bridge-utils`

To confirm it is installed correctly, run:
`sudo modprobe batman-adv`
## Setup Script
After downloading BATMAN.
